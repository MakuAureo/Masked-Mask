# Masked Mask

Makes the Masked's mask an actual item instead of a mesh, also keeps the value of a mask item if a player was converted by holding one to their face.

You can also grab the mask off their head while they are alive, causing them to permanently sprint.

### Note

This mod is compatible with [MaskFixes's](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/MaskFixes/) patches, but not the random chance of the mesh being a tragedy mask.
All naturally spawned Masked will have a comedy mask since it's now scrap instead of a mesh.
